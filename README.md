# ICS-PROJECT-I
This project aims at creating a real-time carpooling system to solve transportation problems in Kenya. The system to be created is an Android application that will use matching algorithms to match the users(drivers and passengers). The user is authenticated into the mobile application. They can either search for a driver or search for passengers. If the user is traveling in a certain direction, they can fill out a form on the details of their trip including the destination, number of passengers, stops to be made, and other general information on the trip. All potential passengers will be shown, and the driver can choose the most convenient passengers. Alternatively, prospective passengers can also search for drivers who share their interested route, and the appropriate drivers will be shown. Driver and passenger(s) then decide on pick-up points before the trip begins and necessary payments are made. Details of the trip such as trip information will still be visible and available for sharing. The driver and passenger will then rate each other for future purposes.
